Where modules exist, they are predominantly classroom taught (passive learning), with notable divergences in the content, scope and quality. There are very few online courses on the MOOC platform that address issues pertaining to biosecurity. Currently, only four online courses touch on such issues. Each of these are taught courses, and therefore only available at certain times of the year.This project will build upon the joint UK-Canada funded publication �Preventing Biological Threats: What can you do?: A guide to biological security issues and how to address them� produced by Bradford University (2015), updating and amending content in line with new developments in the field and in light of a new international certification in biosecurity, in order to deliver open-access online training tools, underpinned by best practice in active and blended learning.\n","assistance_type":"Direct financial assistance","project_id":"proj.303249","ghsa_funding":false,"core_capacities":["P.6","D.4",""],"donor_name":"United Kingdom","donor_sector":"Government","donor_code":"GB","recipient_name":"United Kingdom","recipient_sector":"Government","recipient_country":"GB","years":["2017","2018","2019"],"commitment_disbursements":"disbursement","transactions":[{"type":"disbursement","amount":15921.734999999999,"cy":"2017","currency":"USD"},{"type":"disbursement","amount":15162.415,"cy":"2018","currency":"USD"},{"type":"disbursement","amount":15769.911999999998,"cy":"2019","currency":"USD"}],"total_spent":31084.15,"total_committed":0,"spent_by_year":{"2014":0,"2015":0,"2016":0,"2017":15921.734999999999,"2018":15162.415,"2019":15769.911999999998},"committed_by_year":{"2014":0,"2015":0,"2016":0,"2017":0,"2018":0},"source":{"id":"","name":"Article X","added_by":"Talus","mmddyyyy_added":"03192019"}},{"project_name":"Development Research","project_description":"Research project grants and research network grants focusing on: prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases;

Phase I activities (March-August 2016) included reconnaissance and data collation at priority laboratories and biosecurity training. Phase II (Sept 2016-Sept 2017) initiated data collection, temporary consolidation of samples and security upgrades at three sites and produced the design for a new �Biobank� and associated lab for securing all samples, which is being provided by GPP in Phase III (Sept 2017-June 2018).

The Centre's vision is to pioneer global science in entomology, to improve the well-being and resilience of people and the environment to the challenges of a changing world, through innovative and applied research, alongside deep exploratory study, impact assessment, evaluation and sustainable capacity building. Some insects are disease vectors and are responsible for the transmission of dilapidating human and livestock diseases, exacerbating Africa�s already disproportionate share of the global disease burden. Such diseases include malaria (transmitted by mosquitoes), human and animal trypanosomosis, commonly known as sleeping sickness and nagana respectively, which are transmitted by tsetse.

Most importantly, this proposal will contribute to Provincial and National government targets set forth in the IV National Strategic Plan for the HIV Response 2015-2019; the HIV Programme Acceleration Plan; and, the National Plan for Elimination of Vertical Transmission of HIV; National and Provincial PESS; and, the objectives set forth in the Test & Treat Strategy adopted in 2016.","assistance_type":"Direct financial assistance","project_id":"proj.303331","ghsa_funding":false,"core_capacities":["R.4",""],"donor_name":"Italy","donor_sector":"Government","donor_code":"IT","recipient_name":"Sofala","recipient_sector":"Government","recipient_country":"sofala","years":["2016","2017"],"commitment_disbursements":"disbursement","transactions":[{"type":"disbursement","amount":607977.63,"cy":"2016","currency":"USD"},{"type":"disbursement","amount":596715.795,"cy":"2017","currency":"USD"}],"total_spent":1204693.425,"total_committed":0,"spent_by_year":{"2014":0,"2015":0,"2016":607977.63,"2017":596715.795,"2018":0},"committed_by_year":{"2014":0,"2015":0,"2016":0,"2017":0,"2018":0},"source":{"id":"","name":"Article X","added_by":"Talus","mmddyyyy_added":"03192019"},"recipient_amount_unspec":true,"recipient_name_orig":"Mozambique;

(e.g. Marburg, MERS CoV, Rabies, Antrax, Brucellosis, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza). Using this module, the users in the lab can manage the samples storage location, the type and the quantity of biological material stored, etc. SILABFA stores all data relating to the stored samples. When samples are received, the user can decide to proceed with analysis of the sample or to simply store the sample until further analysis at a later point in time.
