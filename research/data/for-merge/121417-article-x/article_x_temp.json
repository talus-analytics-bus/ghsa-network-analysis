Worldwide there are few dedicated university modules addressing biosecurity. Where modules exist, they are predominantly classroom taught (passive learning), with notable divergences in the content, scope and quality. There are very few online courses on the MOOC platform that address issues pertaining to biosecurity. Currently, only four online courses touch on such issues. Each of these are taught courses, and therefore only available at certain times of the year. This project will build upon the joint UK-Canada funded publication ‘Preventing Biological Threats: What can you do?: A guide to biological security issues and how to address them’ produced by Bradford University (2015), updating and amending content in line with new developments in the field and in light of a new international certification in biosecurity, in order to deliver open-access online training tools, underpinned by best practice in active and blended learning. The purpose of the course is to ensure that students gain a comprehensive understanding of the biosecurity challenges inherent in the life sciences, responses to risks, and their place in ensuring that relevant science and technology is used safely and securely. To that end, the overarching learning objectives as set out in Preventing Biological Threats are to enable students to a) Assess, evaluate and make informed judgements about biological benefits and threats and global responses to them, b) Evaluate the biosecurity aspects of scientific research and industrial processes, and ensure their own work is responsibly conducted, and c) Collaborate with others in government, academia or industry to inform and educate colleagues about biosecurity issues. The project is divided into three phases:  Phase one (complete) was the development of a detailed implementation plan through the performance of six activities (background research, gap analysis, identification of experts to present material, development of a method to review material, review material & development of a recording plan). This phase was designed to review the source materials (Preventing Biological Threats and the body of knowledge contained in the IFBA Biosecurity certification), describe how they will be improved, and decide expert engagement and a detailed timeline for accomplishing the project. Phase two (ongoing) will encompass the recording and editing of the substantive material, including up to 20 videos, each presented by a suitable expert and making use of updated materials. Phase three (ongoing) comprises the construction of the course, including integrating subject matter videos and team-based learning tools. Course content will be supplemented by purpose-written multiple-choice questions for use in assessing learning impact and for final certification in the course. The University of Bath will conduct an internal review and testing with a pool of students, before the final sign-off and online launch of the course."

There is no doubt that, due to the revolutionary progress in the life sciences, access to information, technologies and materials which may be used with malicious intent is becoming increasingly easy and affordable for the vast majority of countries, certain groups and individuals.  The main objectives of this project are to collect information, develop a network and to disseminate knowledge on biosafety, biosecurity and bioethics amongst life sciences experts, specialists in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries; and to prepare and submit to the Government of Ukraine, relevant ministries, agencies and universities, recommendations on the need to implement obligatory curriculum covering biosafety, biosecurity, and dual-use for students studying biology, medicine and agrarian sciences at university level.  Specific project activities to date have included i) the development of guidelines and training materials on biosecurity, biosafety and bioethics for teachers, lecturers and mentors in the medical, biological and agricultural sciences, ii) the translation and printing of the joint UK and Canadian-funded publications ‘Preventing Biological Threats: What You Can Do?’ and ‘Biological Security Education Handbook: The Power of Team-Based Learning’ and iii) development and maintenance of the website www.bsseducation.com.ua. In order to develop and improve the teaching methods, the materials developed during the course of this project have been presented at well-attended regional workshops and conferences, and International symposia. Reference material and resources from these symposiums, as well as details of the testing of the proposed educational module; have been specified on the website. Implementation of this project will make a significant contribution to the development of a reliable biosecurity and biosafety system in Ukraine, and may serve as an example for other countries.

These events that have been linked to climate change resulted in massive losses due to fatalities, reduced productivity, reproductive failures, restricted animal movements/trade, and surveillance/vaccination costs. PALE-Blu brings together European institutes with expertise in BTV research and diagnosis, with partners in endemic regions (Africa, the Middle East and Turkey) that act as a ‘source’ for BTV strains that emerge in Europe. Full-genome sequence-analyses will increase the accuracy of BTV-strain distribution maps, to identify pathways and mechanisms for spread into and within Europe, as well as appropriate prevention strategies. PALE-Blu will analyse the genetic connectivity of Culicoides vector populations in different regions, as well as the movements of individual BTV lineages and genes. Together with reverse genetics technologies and infection/replication studies in new Culicoides cell lines, or adults from different Culicoides species, this will elucidate the genetic basis for geographic localisation/movement of BTV strains and serotypes. We will analyse differences in saliva proteins from Culicoides species, their ability to modify the BTV surface proteins (proteases) and effects on efficiency of transmission (in both directions) between vertebrae hosts and insect-vectors. These studies will provide a better understanding of incursion risks for different BTV strains, supporting effective control strategies. PALE-BLU will explore more effective and cross-serotype subunit-vaccines that are DIVA assay compatible and generate a stronger immune response from a single innoculation. We will also explore the potential for use of antiviral agents to induce immediate protection post vaccination. More effective diagnostic systems to better detect mixed infections will also be developed by multiplexing existing or novel diagnostic assay systems."
